Three educational assembly programs for an 80x86 microprocessor. The first code (bin_to_hex.asm) converts an 8-bit binary number input into its corresponding hexadecimal number. The second code (hex_to_bin) does the exact opposite. It takes as input a 2-digit hexadecimal number and prints its corresponding 8-bit binary number. The third code takes a hexa number as input and displays the binary output in the terminal. Also, the binary output is used indirectly to calculate the decimal number displayed in the led_display.exe.
