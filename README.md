The first code (bin_to_hex.asm) is an assembly program for an 80x86 microprocessor that converts an 8-bit binary number input into its corresponding hexadecimal number. The second code (hex_to_bin) does the exact opposite. It takes as input a 1-digit hexadecimal number and prints its corresponding 8-bit binary number
